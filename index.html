     this week just passed nothing important happened the week was just 
     another week and to be honest it seems like something big will happen 
     soon and yeah this week was just a week. Except for the part where we made 
     filtration systems.</p>

      for the first part of my project I built the car body and we had to revise
      it about 3 or 4 time and we had alot of trouble finding a good way to make 
      wheels and to make everything level and everything smooth. That was the
      first two weeks. then we had to find out how we were going to wire and put
      everything inside the car and keep it stable and supported. I did the 
      manual labor basically while bryson and nathan did all the cool techy stuff
      I had alot of fun though saudering was my favorite part of it all and we 
      did pretty good when we tested it and im proud of myself and everyone in
      my group.</p>

          we started our cardboard boat project and to be honest it is very 
          iffy and not even close to the final project because I have to try and 
          make it floatable with only 45 yards of tape or a full roll of tape 
          which I dont think will be enough by we shall see.</P>

          school has been very stressfull with all the testing and more and 
          on top of that school is coming to a close and I dont know how to 
          feel because I have been very sad and dont know why but I will soon 
          because everything gets resolved at some point.</p>
